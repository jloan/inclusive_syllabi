### Beginnings

* Attended a [SBCTC Accessibilty](https://sbctc.instructure.com/courses/1578604) Retreat. (2017)[^1]
* Saw a presentation by Sara Godrick-Rab at AtD Conference on [basic needs security in the community College](https://medium.com/@saragoldrickrab/basic-needs-security-and-the-syllabus-d24cc7afe8c9). (2018)
* At Race and Pedagogy Conference at UPS. Attended session about designing a "Writing Inclusively" section of UPS's [*SoundWriting Handbook*](https://soundwriting.pugetsound.edu/). (2018)
* Via various venues (conferences, other instructors syllabi, etc.) I come into contact with  [acknowledgments](https://usdac.us/nativeland) of Native Land and Peoples. (2014 - present)

### Basic Needs Security Statement

Sara Godrick-Rab's Basic Needs Statement:
>Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable her to provide any resources that she may possess.

My Basic Needs Statement:
>Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact [Student Support Services](https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/support-services). Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess.

>In short, if you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.

### Acknowledgement of Indigenous Land and Peoples

Jentry Sayer's [statement of acknowledgement](https://jentery.github.io/508v4/#acknowledgements-):
>As a faculty member who has the privilege to live and work as a guest on these lands, I acknowledge with respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

As of yet, I do not have a statement drafted. That is something I would like to work on. In preparation for drafting, I have been using *[Honor Our Native Land: A Guide and Call to Acknowledgement](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive).*

A possible template (using Sayers):
>As a faculty member who has the privilege to live and work as a guest on these lands, I acknowledge with respect the _______-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the college stands and the ________, ____________, and _________ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

How does this template align with best practices for composing statments of acknowledgement?


### Equity, Diversity and Inclusion

Admittedly, I've lost a sense of where I sourced this from...but here is what's currently in my syllabus:
>My goal is to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Pierce records, please let me know.  

>Creating this environment also includes my commitment to value the diversity of our language practices. School for many is often a place where judgements about language have been harnessed both intentionally and unintentionally to marginalize people and set-up barriers to success. The composition classroom is a place where we can come to more critically understand how language plays a role in issues of inclusion/exclusion in the world.

>I (like all of us) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, as a participant in course discussions and work, I expect you to also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.

##### Footnotes:

[^1]: The beginnings can be traced back further regarding issues of assessment. In particular, teaching in the UNC Writing Program where we were supported in using *contract grading* (see Elbow and Danielewicz) and in coming into contact with the work of Asao B. Inoue around [anti-racist assessment practices](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/perspectives/inoue/). Will address that in a future iteration of this page.
